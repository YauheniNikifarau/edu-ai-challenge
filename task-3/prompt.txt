AI Technique: Text Summarization; Sentiment Analysis
This task focuses on using prompting techniques with the OpenAI online chat interface (e.g., ChatGPT) to perform text summarization and sentiment analysis. You will practice crafting effective prompts to achieve specific outputs without the need for API integration.
Text Summarization: the process of condensing a large body of text into a shorter version while retaining its essential meaning and key information. This can be achieved via two main approaches:
Extractive Summarization: Selecting and combining key sentences or phrases from the original text.
Abstractive Summarization: Generating new sentences and paraphrasing the content for conciseness.
Sentiment Analysis: a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone of a given piece of text. It identifies whether the sentiment is:
Positive: Reflecting optimism or satisfaction.
Neutral: Lacking strong emotional indicators.
Negative: Reflecting dissatisfaction, criticism, or pessimism.
Sentiment scores are often represented numerically, where:
-1 indicates very negative sentiment.
0 indicates neutral sentiment.
+1 indicates very positive sentiment.
Example 1
- Text: "I love how easy this app is to use. Great job!"
- Sentiment: Positive
- Score: +1
Example 2
- Text: "The website keeps crashing every time I try to log in."
-  Sentiment: Negative
- Score: -1

Remote work, also known as telecommuting, has become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly after the global pandemic forced many companies to adapt to flexible working arrangements. The advantages of remote work are numerous. Employees often report higher job satisfaction due to the elimination of long commutes, increased flexibility in managing work-life balance, and the ability to work from the comfort of their homes. For companies, remote work can lead to lower operational costs, since there is less need for office space and associated expenses.

However, remote work is not without its challenges. Many employees struggle with feelings of isolation and a lack of connection to their colleagues, which can negatively impact collaboration and team dynamics. Moreover, some workers find it difficult to maintain productivity due to distractions at home or the blurred boundaries between personal and professional life. Employers, on the other hand, may face difficulties in monitoring employee performance and ensuring consistent communication across teams.

Despite these challenges, remote work is likely here to stay. Companies are exploring hybrid models that combine the benefits of in-office collaboration with the flexibility of remote work. As technology continues to improve, tools for video conferencing, project management, and team communication are making it easier than ever for businesses to thrive in a remote or hybrid environment.
