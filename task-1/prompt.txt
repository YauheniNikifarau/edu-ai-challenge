Hi, you are a database professional. I need to build a platform with the following requirements:
1. It should be able to handle millions of users.
2. Need to store profiles, posts, and connections between users
3. High data read speed required
4. Expected 80% read operations, 20% write operations
5. Scalability is important as the user base grows

Analyze these requirements and offer me the best choice of database (SQL, NO-SQL etc.).
Apply Chain-of-Thought reasoning approach in your answer.
